# Engagement - NOTES 

Here is Eagle IO's definition of engagement:

A state of personal immersion in work characterized by enthusiasm, dedication, and personal investment, expressed cognitively, affectively, and behaviorally in the proactive pursuit of advancing organizational goals.

This definition was created by Eagle IO on Spring 2019, and modified by Dr. Kulas and Renata on Fall 2019 to include the four dimensions of Fulfillment, Absorbtion, Dedication, and Vigor. 

## Feb 20.2020
Decided to operationalize fullfillment as an outcome of engagement rather than a definitional element 
Considering removing fulfillment

Reconceptualized as an OUTCOME of engagement (2/20) 

Fulfillment: finding meaning in one's work, while having a sense of autonomy, growth, usefulness, achievement, and feeling appreciated by org. [Satisfaction(?)]


## Definitions as of 02.20.2020

being fully concentrated and happily immersed in ones work (time passes quickly and has difficulty detaching from ones work; Schaufeli et al., 2002)

After completing individual Q-sorts (Kulas and Renata) we decided to revisit the definitions and build them up a little to make the diference between them more noticible. 

## Definitions as of 5/19/2020

Absorption: Being fully immersed in oneâ€™s work, where time passes quickly and one has difficulty detaching from work tasks

Vigor: Experiencing persistent levels of energy, effort, and enthusiasm while working

Dedication: Experiencing pride and challenge in ones work, as well as strong feelings of support from and loyalty toward the organization

With these definitions we ordered all the items according to the ones we individually selected for each category and created an item bank with the remaining items. Together we placed the items in the bank into the agreed upon categories. 

Next steps: 
Place items in the DAV categories into the ABC categories

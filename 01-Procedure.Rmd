# Introduction {#intro}

We lost the document where we had saved the citations for the creation of our engagement dimensions. we found it today (02/04/2020). 
Three out of the four dimensions (Dedication, Vigor, and Absorbtion) came from Schaufeli et al, (2002), and we are trying to find where Fulfillment came from. 
We are also trying to improve the definition of each domain by looking at the current items and conducting a Modified Q sort (not correct name) to create piles of items that have commonalities within each domain.
